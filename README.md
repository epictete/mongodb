# MongoDB basic tutorial

Welcome to my quick introduction on how to use MongoDB.  
In this guide you will find :

1. How to [install](install.md) MongoDB.
1. How to [manage](manage.md) the MongoDB service.
1. How to do basic [CRUD](CRUD.md) operations.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive reference guide, but rather a quick access cheat sheet.  
You can find MongoDB's official documentation [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/).
